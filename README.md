# CC_Terrain_Adaptive
We propose a discrete dynamic programming algorithm with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme to model a terrain-adaptive cruise controller. The proposed controller combines the best driving practices of humans and the tracking ability of a conventional cruise controller. We demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed controller on different synthetic road profiles through simulations, using the parametric details of a heavy-duty vehicle. The code is in Julia. More details are in the pdf.
